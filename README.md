## Mission

**Connect to AI agents from the terminal with a great user experience.**

Openagent is a focused fork of [opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) that targets the [AgentOS](https://docs.agno.com/agent-os/introduction) API exclusively. We believe the terminal is the natural home for developers working with AI agents, and we're building the best client to make that experience seamless.

## What We're Building

Openagent is a terminal-first client for the [Agno AgentOS](https://docs.agno.com/agent-os/introduction) ecosystem:

- **Discover** — Browse and connect to available AgentOS agents
- **Interact** — Chat with agents using a polished TUI experience
- **Integrate** — Work with agents that have tools, memory, and MCP capabilities
- **Develop** — Test and debug your own AgentOS agents locally

## Project Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope (for now) |
|----------|------------------------|
| AgentOS API integration | Other AI provider APIs |
| Terminal UI (TUI) client | Web or desktop-first experiences |
| Local agent development | Cloud deployment |
| MCP server support | Enterprise features |

We're keeping the scope focused to deliver a great experience for the AgentOS ecosystem. The upstream opencode project handles multi-provider support — openagent is purpose-built for AgentOS.

> [!TIP]
> Remove versions older than 0.1.x before installing.

### Desktop App (BETA)

OpenCode is also available as a desktop application. Download directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/releases) or [opencode.ai/download](https://opencode.ai/download).

| Platform              | Download                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `opencode-desktop-darwin-aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel)         | `opencode-desktop-darwin-x64.dmg`     |
| Windows               | `opencode-desktop-windows-x64.exe`    |
| Linux                 | `.deb`, `.rpm`, or AppImage           |

# Windows (Scoop)
scoop bucket add extras; scoop install extras/opencode-desktop
```

#### Installation Directory

The install script respects the following priority order for the installation path:

1. `$OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR` - Custom installation directory
2. `$XDG_BIN_DIR` - XDG Base Directory Specification compliant path
3. `$HOME/bin` - Standard user binary directory (if exists or can be created)
4. `$HOME/.opencode/bin` - Default fallback

```bash
# Examples
OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
XDG_BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

### Agents

OpenCode includes two built-in agents you can switch between with the `Tab` key.

- **build** - Default, full access agent for development work
- **plan** - Read-only agent for analysis and code exploration
  - Denies file edits by default
  - Asks permission before running bash commands
  - Ideal for exploring unfamiliar codebases or planning changes

Also, included is a **general** subagent for complex searches and multistep tasks.
This is used internally and can be invoked using `@general` in messages.

### Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to OpenCode, please read our [contributing docs](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.

### Building on OpenCode

If you are working on a project that's related to OpenCode and is using "opencode" as a part of its name; for example, "opencode-dashboard" or "opencode-mobile", please add a note to your README to clarify that it is not built by the OpenCode team and is not affiliated with us in any way.

### FAQ

#### How is this different from Claude Code?

It's very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:

- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider. Although we recommend the models we provide through [OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/zen); OpenCode can be used with Claude, OpenAI, Google or even local models. As models evolve the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop so being provider-agnostic is important.
- Out of the box LSP support
- A focus on TUI. OpenCode is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what's possible in the terminal.
- A client/server architecture. This for example can allow OpenCode to run on your computer, while you can drive it remotely from a mobile app. Meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.
